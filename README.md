# OpenFisca-NL: Dutch Rules-as-Code Model

OpenFisca-NL is a rules-as-code implementation of the Dutch tax and benefit system, based on official legislation published by the Belastingdienst (Dutch Tax Authority) and the Rijksoverheid (Dutch Government).

## Scope

This package currently models the following components of the Dutch tax system:

- **Box 1 Income Tax (Inkomstenbelasting)**
  - Progressive tax brackets for wages and self-employment income
  - Tax brackets for 2023, 2024, and 2025

- **Tax Credits (Heffingskortingen)**
  - General tax credit (algemene heffingskorting)
  - Labor tax credit (arbeidskorting)

- **Self-Employment (Zelfstandigen)**
  - Self-employed deduction (zelfstandigenaftrek) - only applied if `urencriterium_voldaan` is true for the year
  - SME profit exemption (mkb-winstvrijstelling)
  - Hours criterion (urencriterium) requirement

- **Social Security Contributions**
  - Simplified model of AOW, WLZ, and other contributions

- **Property Tax (OZB)**
  - Simplified municipal property tax model

## Disclaimer

This package implements official Dutch rules in code form, based on publicly available legislation. It is **not affiliated with the Dutch government** and should **not be relied upon for personal tax filing**. Always consult official sources or a qualified tax advisor for tax advice.

## How the Model Works

All modeling happens within the `openfisca_nl` folder:

- The **parameters** folder contains tax rates, brackets, and thresholds from official sources
- The **variables** folder contains the formulas that calculate taxes and benefits
- The **reforms** folder (optional) contains experimental policy modifications

The files that are outside from the `openfisca_nl` folder are
used to set up the development environment.

## Packaging your Country Package for Distribution

Country packages are Python distributions. You can choose to distribute your
package automatically via the predefined continuous deployment system on GitHub
Actions, or manually.

### Automatic continuous deployment on GitHub

This repository is configured with a continuous deployment system to automate
the distribution of your package via `pip`.

#### Setting up continuous deployment

To activate the continuous deployment:

1. Create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) if you don't already have
   one.
2. Generate a token in your PyPI account. This token will allow GitHub Actions
   to securely upload new versions of your package to PyPI.
3. Add this token to your GitHub repository's secrets under the name
   `PYPI_TOKEN`.

Once set up, changes to the `main` branch will trigger an automated workflow to
build and publish your package to PyPI, making it available for `pip`
installation.

### Manual distribution

If you prefer to manually manage the release and distribution of your package,
follow the guidelines provided by the
[Python Packaging Authority](https://python-packaging-user-guide.readthedocs.io/tutorials/distributing-packages/#packaging-your-project).

This involves detailed steps on preparing your package, creating distribution
files, and uploading them to PyPI.

## Install Instructions for Users and Contributors

This package requires
[Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) or higher. More
recent versions should work, but are not tested.

All platforms that can execute Python are supported, which includes GNU/Linux,
macOS and Microsoft Windows.

### Setting-up a Virtual Environment with venv

In order to limit dependencies conflicts, we recommend using a
[virtual environment](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/) with
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

- A [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is a project specific
  environment created to suit the needs of the project you are working on.

To create a virtual environment, launch a terminal on your computer, `cd` into
your directory and follow these instructions:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv # create a new virtual environment in the “.venv” folder, which will contain all dependencies
source .venv/bin/activate # activate the venv
```

You can now operate in the venv you just created.

You can deactivate that venv at any time with `deactivate`.
